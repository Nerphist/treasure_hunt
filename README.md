# Treasure map task
The task was done in OOP and functional ways 
## Functional way (recursive)
main/functional_recursion_solution/
<br>
Everything is inside the one main function
`search_for_treasure`
## OOP way
main/oop_solution/
<br>
There are three classes used here:
<br>
`TreasureMap` - generator for finding right coordinates
<br>
`Coordinates` - wrapper class for integer coordinates made for better abstraction and comfort
<br>
`Solver` - class for finding the final solution as a string
